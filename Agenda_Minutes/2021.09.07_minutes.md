## Antitrust Policy
Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy. If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.

- **[Conference & Comms Policy]()**

AH: This might have some overlap with community WG. We have a [new project process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WxbtbO_FCrOBa0Lw7ti8Vr2-Dd5KdLW8FMwdgKgt26o/edit?usp=sharing) to define the scope, required resources to allocate, and orgs involved. 
AC: Having some guidamce here would be extremely helpful.

Decisions made: AC to bring completed project template to review next week. Communication between the meetings - will happen in the discussion.

**[Good examples of guidance on trademark usage](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/trademark_policy/discussions/13)**

CA: We are going to use the discussions to collate examaples of trademark guidance - as reference when sharing with our designer(s).

SM: Will follow up with legal expertise internal to the Linux Foundation, and share back to discuss at a future meeting.

**[Acceptable use - use of the foundation name, and "green software"](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/trademark_policy/issues/6)**

CA: One thing we discussed was having guidance for comms around green software - there are already some pretty clear, significant decisions in the SCI, like eschewing offsets / RECs, or emphasising system emissions over local emissions. We agreed to start drafting a position paper summarising these, to review for future meetings.
